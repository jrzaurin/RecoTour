# Neural Collaborative Filtering

Pytorch implementation of the algorithm described in [Xiangnan He, et. all
2017, Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05031.pdf).

A detail description of the algorithm components and the training/validation
process can be found in the notebooks.

Examples of how to run it can be found in `run_experiments.sh`. I have tried a
number of different combinations including [Cyclic learning
rates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01186.pdf).

    "## Multinomial Variation Autoencoder for Collaborative Filtering\n",

    "I must admit that when it comes to variational autoencoders (VAEs) I find that there is a \"notable\" difference between the complexity of the math and that of the code (or maybe is just me that I am not a mathematician). Nonetheless, I think that speaking about VAEs and not mentioning log likelihoods, Evidence Lower Bound (EBLO) or the Kullback–Leibler divergence ($\\text{D}_{\\text{KL}}$) is almost like \"cheating\". With that in mind I will try to give some mathematical context to the $\\text{Mult-VAE}^{\\text{PR}}$ for collaborative filtering and then move to the code, from how one prepares the data to a discussion of the results. Bear in mind that the whole purpose of the math below is to justify the loss function we will be using when training the $\\text{Mult-VAE}^{\\text{PR}}$ as well as the architecture of the algorithm.\n",

Looking at the loss function in Eq (12) within the context of VAEs, we can see that the first term is the reconstruction loss, while the $D_{KL}$ act as a regularizer. With that in mind, Liang et al add a factor $\\beta$ to control the strength of the regularization, and propose $\\beta < 1$. Let's paused for one second and think on what this means. First of all, we are no longer optimizing a lower bound for a given log likelihood. In addition, remember that the $D_{KL}$ divergence measures the similarity between the approximate posterior $q_\\phi(\\textbf{z}_u\\vert \\textbf{x}_u)$ and the prior $p_\\theta(\\textbf{z}_u)$. Therefore, by using $\\beta < 1$ we are weakening the influence of the prior constrain $q_\\phi(\\textbf{z}_u\\vert \\textbf{x}_u) \\approx p_\\theta(\\textbf{z}_u)$ on the loss. This means that we are less able to generalize to novel user clicks from historical data. However, when building recommendation systems we are often not interested in reproducing precisely click histories (i.e. achieving the best loss) but in making good recommendations (i.e. achieving the best ranking metrics). As the authors show in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05814.pdf) (and we will see here later), the best ranking metrics are obtained when using $\\beta < 1$ and in consequence they name the algorithm Partially Regularized Multinomial Autoencoder or $\\text{Mult-VAE}^{\\text{PR}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And...\"*that's it!*\". After all this we are ready to move to the code. There are two comments to make as we move to the code. I have implemented the Mult-VAE using `Mxnet` and `Pytorch`. Given the fact that these two implementations are nearly identical, I will concentrate here only on the `Mxnet` implementation, please go to the repo if you want to have a look to the `Pytorch` one. Secondly, the paper also includes a Multinomial Denoising Autoencoder, referred as Mult-DAE. However, given its simplicity relative to the formulation of the Mult-VAE discussed here I will not discussed the math of the Mult-DAE and focus simply on the code."

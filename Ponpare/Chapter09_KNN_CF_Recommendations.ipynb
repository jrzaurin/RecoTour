    "### 9.1 KNN Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of blog posts and literature one can find regarding to this technique is *gigantic*. Therefore, I will not spend much time explaining how it works. For example, have a look [here](https://beckernick.github.io/music_recommender/). Let me also use this opportunity to recommend one good book about recommender systems: [Recommender Systems](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Recommender-Systems-Textbook-Charu-Aggarwal/dp/3319296574/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1531491611&sr=8-1&keywords=recommender+systems). \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, here is a quick explanation. In Chapter 8 we built an *\"Interaction Matrix\"* (hereafter $R$ as a generic reference to *rating matrix*) of dimensions $U\\times I$ where $U$ is the number of users and $I$ is the number of items. Each element of that matrix $R_{ij}$ is the interest of user $i$ in coupon $j$. If we transpose this matrix ($R^{T}$) we can use it to compute the similarity between coupons based on how user interacted with them. Then, if a user has shown interest in a given coupon, we can recommend similar coupons based on that similarity metric. In other words, we can recommend similar items using **item-based collaborative filtering**. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as straightforward this approach might sound, there is an caveat here, and in any approach that is based purely on past interaction between users and items. This is, the coupons that need to be recommended in a given week, have never been seen before. Therefore, they are not in $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to \"overcomplicate\" things a bit simply because I thought any \"tour\" through recommendation algorithms without at least illustrating the use of CF is not complete. What we will do is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use kNN CF as usual, recommending training coupons based on interactions.\n",
    "2. As in previous chapters, we will compute the distance between training and validation coupons using only coupon features. \n",
    "3. We will build a dictionary mapping training into validation coupons. \n",
    "4. We will map training coupon recommendations into validation coupon recommendation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this is overcomplicating if not even misusing the technique...Anyway, one advantage might be that we add some sense of interaction-based recommendation as we recommend the new coupons. Still, you might wonder: *\"why not simply recommend to a given user those new coupons in validation that resemble more to those he/she interacted with during training?!\"* And you will be right to ask that. I will leave this as an exercise if you want to do it. Simply: 1) take the $N$ coupons a user interacted with during training. 2) Find the corresponding most similar validation coupons and 3) rank them based on similarity and maybe consider adding a weight based on interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that in mind, let's go."

In other words, if you import them afterwards, `joblib` will not run, or will do it very slow and not using all cores. There are a few [ways around](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15639779/why-does-multiprocessing-use-only-a-single-core-after-i-import-numpy), but the easiest one is simply to import joblib after having imported all other required packages (sometimes works, sometimes does not).

It normally performs really well and there are kNN implementations in [python](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) that are really fast and ready for production (apart from, of course, the `sklearn` one). Therefore, if I faced a problem where I need to recommend existing and new products and I can afford it, I will probably build two algorithms: one based on CF for the existing products with recorded interactions/ratings, and another one based purely on features for new products (or a hybrid version)."

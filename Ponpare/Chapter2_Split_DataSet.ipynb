    "### 1. Split the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the excercise in this repo we will not be using the test dataset provided by Kaggle. This dataset has no information on whether the recommendations are good or bad (of course. This is tested at kaggle's side) and we are not taking part of any competition. Therefore, we will carry on as if the training dataset is all we have, and we will split the training dataset into train, validation and testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned in `Chapter 0` there is a temporal component to this problem. As written in the Kaggle's site: *\"You are provided with a year of transactional data for 22,873 users on the site ponpare.jp. The training set spans the dates 2011-07-01 to 2012-06-23. The test set spans the week after the end of the training set, 2012-06-24 to 2012-06-30. The goal of the competition is to recommend a ranked list of coupons for each user in the dataset (found in user_list.csv). Your predictions are scored against the actual coupon purchases, made during the test set week, of the 310 possible test set coupons.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we will split the dataset according to this set up, this is: we will use the last week of data as test dataset, the previous week as validation, and the rest of the data will be our training data. However, the code below is written so that one has flexibility to choose the testing period (`tp`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move into the code, let's just clarify a few additional aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interactions**: I refer to visits and purchases as \"interactions\".\n",
    "2. **Coupons**: based on the testing set provided by kaggle, testing coupons are selected based on the dispfrom column. In addition, kaggle provides coupon features for the testing coupons. Therefore we will explore two scenarios. In the first one we will assume that \"our company\" receives the next week's upcoming coupons with enough time in advance so that we can use *ALL* coupons (train, validation and test coupons) to engineer the features and split the dataset afterwards. Programmatically, this scenario is easier since no new features (as the result of, for example, one-hot enconding) will appear during testing. A second scenario contemplates the fact that we might need to recommend coupons as they come. In this case, we would only have time to do some fast processing (LabelEnconding perhaps) and, since this coupon has never seen before we would have to recommend based on some similarity metric between the new and old coupons (which would also need to be computed fast). All this will become clearer as we go through the code in upcoming chapters.\n",
    "3. **Users**: for the excercise here we will only concentrate in users that have been seen during training. In the real world you need to recommend to everyone. For users that have not interacted at all in the past we know nothing (unless they fill a form or register in your site in which case we might have some demographic information). On top of that, remember that no one has interacted with the upcoming coupons. Altogether, it is straightforward to understand that is hard to recommend well to these users. An easy solution would be recommending new coupons that resemble the most popular coupons in the past. If, in addition, we have some demographic information (age, gender, location) we might want to constrain the definition of *\"similar coupons\"* to groups of similar demographics. In other words, recommend new coupons that are similar to the most popular coupons in the past amongst users of similar age, gender, etc...\n",

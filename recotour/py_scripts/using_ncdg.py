# let's build a fake example to illustrate how one could use the normalised
# discounted cumulative gain (ndcg) for the excercise here.

# To use this metric one needs an estimate of the real relevance of the items
# we recommend. In our case, this would be the interest.

# As it happened before, there is a caveat worth mentioning here. We are
# recommending a few hundred coupons while the users only interacted with a
# few. Therefore, it is not possible to know/compute the real relevance for
# all recommended items. there are 2 ways to go about it:

# 1-We can rank based on interest, keep the top 10 and compute the metric with
# the intersect between those 10 and the ones that the user interacted with, or

# 2-We can extract all the coupons that the user interacted with, with their
# rank. If there are more than 10, we cut at 10, if there are less, we
# proceed.

# We will implement both methods

# let's assume we have 10 users
user_ids = ['user_'+str(i) for i in np.arange(10)]

# and we recommend 50 coupons
recommended_coupon_ids = ['coupon_'+str(i) for i in np.arange(50)]
n_rec = len(recommended_coupon_ids)


# each user interacted with a number of coupons (between 1-50) during testing
np.random.seed(1)
real_interactions = {}
for user in user_ids:
	n_coupons = np.random.randint(1,50)
	coupon_ids = np.random.choice(recommended_coupon_ids, n_coupons)
	interest = [random.random() for _ in range(len(coupon_ids))]
	real_interactions[user] = dict(zip(coupon_ids,interest))

np.random.seed(2)
recommendations = {}
for user in user_ids:
	interest = [np.random.random() for _ in range(len(recommended_coupon_ids))]
	recommendations[user] = dict(zip(recommended_coupon_ids,interest))

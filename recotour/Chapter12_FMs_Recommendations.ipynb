    "### 12.1 Factorization Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "The text in this notebook is based on this [paper](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/ffm.pdf). [Chao Ma](https://github.com/aksnzhy) is the author of the [xlearn](http://xlearn-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start.html) package looks really promising. \n",
    "\n",
    "The differentiating method in `xlearn` is Field Aware Factorization Machines (FFMs), which has been the winning method in a couple of click through rate (CTR) prediction competitions. However, the library also includes [Factorization Machines](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/reading/Rendle2010FM.pdf) (FMs) and linear methods for large datasets. Therefore, we will first explore FMs and then we will move onto FFMs in the next Chapter/notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of packages for Factorization Machines in python: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [pyFM](https://github.com/coreylynch/pyFM)\n",
    "2. [pywFM](https://github.com/jfloff/pywFM)\n",
    "3. [fastFM](https://github.com/jfloff/pywFM)\n",
    "4. [ligtFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm)\n",
    "\n",
    "While I am familiar with `pyFM` and `lightFM`, I have never used the `pywFM` and only \"played a bit\" with `fastFM`. To be honest, with the exception of the `lightFM`, I do not think any of them are production ready. Let me clarify that `lighFM` is not strictly speaking FMs, but a hybrid matrix factorisation model. However, given the resemble between methods (see Section 3 of Maciej Kula's [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08439.pdf)), the author decided to call it `lightFM`, and I think it must be included in the list above.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are factorization machines? Let's see if I can answer this question with some math and plane English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we have $m$ items that are displayed in a site. For each item we have $(y_i, \\boldsymbol{x}_i)$ where $i=1,...,n$, $\\boldsymbol {x}_i$ is an n-dimensional feature vector and $y_i$ is our *\"target\"*, for example whether a user will click on a specific link to an item. In this scenario (logistic regression, click or not) the model can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem, i.e. minimizing the log-loss with regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min\\limits_{w} \\frac{\\lambda}{2} ||w||^{2}_{2} +  \\sum_{i=1}^{m} log(1+exp(-y_i\\phi_{LM}(\\boldsymbol{w},\\boldsymbol{x}_i)))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter and $\\phi_{LM}$ is linear:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_{LM}(\\boldsymbol{w},\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the example in the [Yuchin Juan, et al 2017](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/ffm.pdf) paper. \n",

    "With a linear model, the click probability for this observations would be calculated as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that `Publisher`, `Advertiser` and `Gender` are categorical features. Once one-hot encoded, $x_\\text{ESPN}$ will be 1 if the value for the feature Publisher is ESPN and 0 otherwise, and hence the equality in the expression above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a limitation of that model is that it does not capture feature interactions. A way to address that limitation is using polynomial models, for example, of degree 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_\\text{Poli2} = \\boldsymbol{w}_0 + \\boldsymbol{w}_\\text{ESPN} x_\\text{ESPN} + \\boldsymbol{w}_\\text{Nike} x_\\text{Nike} + \\boldsymbol{w}_\\text{M} x_\\text{M} + \\boldsymbol{w}_\\text{ESPN, Nike} x_\\text{ESPN} x_\\text{Nike} + \\boldsymbol{w}_\\text{Nike, M} x_\\text{ESPN} x_\\text{M} + \\boldsymbol{w}_\\text{ESPN, M} x_\\text{ESPN} x_\\text{M}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "or in a more compact notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_\\text{Poli2}(\\boldsymbol{w}, \\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{w}_{0} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i +  \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \\boldsymbol{w}_{h(i,j)}x_{i} x_{j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h(i, j)$ is a function encoding $i$ and $j$ into a natural number. The complexity of computing that expression is $O(\\overline{n}^2)$, where $\\overline{n}$ is the average non-negative values per instance. One drawback of the Poly2 solution is the \"limited learning\". For example, in our first table, there is only one example of the pair (ESPN, Adidas), and the user did not click. For Poly2, it is likely that a very negative weight $w_\\text{ESPN,Adidas}$ is learned. Also, there are no examples for the pair (NBC, Gucci) and in consequence, no weight will be learned. Such limiation is overcome by Factorization Machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorization Machines (FMs), proposed by Steffen Rendle in his [paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa17/cse291-b/reading/Rendle2010FM.pdf), implicitly learn a latent vector for each feature. Each latent vector contains $k$ latent factors, where $k$ is a user-specified parameter. Then, the effect of feature conjunction is modelled by the inner product of two latent vectors: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_\\text{FM}(\\boldsymbol{w}, \\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{w}_{0} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} (\\boldsymbol{w}_i \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}_j) x_i x_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One can prove that the complexity of computing that expression is $O(\\overline{n}k)$. Since one would expect the number of latent factors to be smaller that the average number of non zero elements per instance, FMs are normally faster than Poly2 approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, for FMs the prediction of (ESPN, Adidas) is determined by $w_\\text{ESPN} \\cdot w_\\text{Adidas}$, and $w_\\text{ESPN}$ and $w_\\text{Adidas}$ are also learned from other pairs (e.g. (ESPN, Nike), (NBC, Adidas)). Therefore, it is likely that the corresponding prediction will be more accurate. Furthermore, even though there is no training data for the pair (NBC, Gucci), because $w_\\text{ESPN}$ and $w_\\text{Adidas}$ can be learned from other pairs, it is still possible to do meaningful predictions with those weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the formulation of the problem is different, the idea is similar to the Matrix Factorization (MF) technique described in the previous chapter. There, the ratings for an item where obtained as the inner product of two latent vectors (item and user latent vectors) with $k$ latent factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One difference is that in the example here, the latent vectors are associated to features (Publisher, Advertiser, etc). However, user and item vectors can also be learned, along with feature latent vectors, when using FMs. You just need to encode them as part of the the sparse matrix of features (see Rendle 2010 his Figure 1). Therefore, if features are important when predicting ratings or CTR, FMs are likely to perform better than MF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I say: *\"if features are important\"*. This is because I sometimes find that using only user behaviour (e.g. interactions) yields better results that using user behaviour plus user and item features. Of course, this is something that needs to be carefully explored when building your algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "I hope at this stage we are clear on why FMs are powerful when building prediction algorithms. Let's use them for the example here with the Ponpare dataset."
